						<p>The original Taco Flats came to life during Austin’s first booming period in the late 1970s, developing quite the reputation as an infamous local hangout. You could always find a friend inside, and entertainment was guaranteed. As an active participant in Austin’s famous music scene, Taco Flats provided a stage for the likes of Gary P. Nunn, Blaze Foley, Calvin Russell, and Townes Van Zandt, just to name a few. And if there wasn’t live music, there was a crowd cheering on a jalapeno eating contest, or maybe an (unofficial) drinking contest. The calmer days were spent simply sharing cheap beer with good company. No matter what, Taco Flats was the place to party and it was always open to everyone. But like all great parties, it had to come to an end when Taco Flats shook off its hangover and closed up shop in October 1981.

						<p>Simon Madera, a local small business owner and entrepreneur, originally sought to open a local neighborhood bar on Burnet Road; something he thought the budding area lacked. Research led him to previous Taco Flats owner, Linda Steele who introduced him to their once-great institution and the legend of her late husband, “Cozzmic Carl” Steele.
						Months after speaking with Linda, who purchased the local dive from Hector Alvarado the original owner of Hector's Taco Flats, Simon received a phone call from the taco man himself. They met, they talked and although from totally different generations both happen to have a lot in common. They both grew up in the Rio Grande Valley, both aspired to do special business endeavors, and both love to entertain guest. Simon felt that meeting the latter owner and the original founder of this great institution was an even bigger inspiration to move the project along. It wasn’t long before Madera decided that Taco Flats should see another successful run in the city that deserved it most.

						<p>The history of Taco Flats is so unique that it needs nothing less than a talented, one of a kind team to bring it back to its former glory. McCray & Co., the Austin design firm whose client list includes the likes of LENOIR, Odd Duck, and Ramen Tatsu-Ya, is working to create an atmosphere that maintains the original feel of Taco Flats, but with an updated twist. Collaboration with craftsman Bill Brasher led to a modern interior design using reclaimed barn wood and vintage light fixtures, accented with splashes of neon and custom furniture. Behind the bar, Aaron Fresas, of Midnight Cowboy and The Highball, consults the development of the cocktail menu, featuring modified cocktail classics to compliment the ntrees and satisfy a discriminating palate. The drink selection also includes a choice of 30+ craft beers, local liquors and wine on tap. Madera worked in collaboration with the students of the University of Texas at Austin’s Creative Advertising Sequence to craft an eye catching roll out and branding campaign to capture the attention of an Austin that’s more fast-paced than ever.
						Taco Flats is for everyone, but especially those who remember what Austin used to be and those who have high hopes for what it can become.
