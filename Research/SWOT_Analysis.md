##SWOT ANALYSIS

###Strengths
* **History:** Bearing the name of a legendary Seventies watering-hole, Taco Flats draws inspiration from the classic, eclectic style Austin is known for. Owner Simon Madera purchased the rights to the name from the original owners, and the heritage of the famous hippie institution is an undeniable benefit.
* **Decor:** Madera worked with the design firm McCray & Co., known for designing some of the highest profile Austin interiors, to come up with a handcrafted, recycled aesthetic that also feels contemporary and clean.
* **Food:** The menu features simple, homemade Mexican fare. From homemade tortillas, Al Pastor carved off an authentic trompo, and jicama “tortillas” for diners avoiding gluten, a priority is quality and taste.
* **Drinks:** A cocktail menu was created by Justin Mork of East Side Show Room that features agave prominently and features a variety of innovative takes on Mexican bar classics.
* **Neighborhood:** The neighborhood, Burnet Road (or BuRo) is experiencing a dining revival. Some of the most hotly anticipated restaurants have opened up along the stretch within the past 2-3 years.

###Weaknesses
* **Backlash:** Using the name of an iconic Austin dive bar also welcomes criticism from those who see it as a cynical ploy for instant credibility. Also, with most things Austin, a deep distrust of anything that vaguely resembles “hipster” can prove to be a drawback.
* **Service:** The system in which diners order their food and drinks has proven to be confusing. There isn’t table service for orders, they must be placed at the window, and drinks at the bar; service staff will then attend to diners at their tables. This has led to much confusion and often annoyance. The general quality of waitstaff, as with most Austin restaurants, leaves much to be desired.

###Opportunities
* **Location:** With a location like Burnet Road, the opportunities are strong. It’s already become a primary destination for dining. With the announcement of several new, high profile restaurants within the next several months, this can only prove to be a positive for the restaurant.
* **Catering:** Madera has plans to introduce a catering side to the business, available to book online and scalable to an off-premises expansion.

###Threats
* **Competition:** Mexican food in Austin, Texas is a cutthroat business. Most diners have palates sophisticated enough to appreciate the flavors of traditional Mexican dishes. If you plan on “upscaling” your menu, it must come from a foundation of authenticity.
* **Oversupply:** The hazard of being located within an overabundance of restaurants is the possibility of simply failing to stand out. Their identity being linked to a period of time when Austin was freewheeling and fun may work for now, but can it endure?
