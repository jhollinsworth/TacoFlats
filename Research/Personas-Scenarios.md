###PERSONAS

##Randall

Randall is an Austin old-timer. He moved here to attend UT in the sixties and never left. He was around to see Stevie Ray play Antone’s, ZZ Top at Armadillo World Headquarters, and Freddy Fender at Soap Creek Saloon. Recently retired from a career with the Postal Service, these days Randall and his wife take pleasure in sampling the explosion of new restaurants that have redefined the city as a dining mecca. Both being children of the sixties, they’ve managed to keep their palates as open as their minds, and they enjoy a varied range of cuisines.

##Mindy

Mindy is a registered nurse who lives in Allandale. She and her husband have been thrilled with the revitalization of Burnet Road and how that has been affecting the improvements in real estate construction on their own block. Many Saturday afternoons are spent walking or biking to a newly opened shop or restaurant with their 8-year-old. Gone are the days of chain fast food being the sole option, now they live in a true neighborhood.

###SCENARIOS

##Randall

Reading and hearing about the recent string of new restaurants opening on Burnet Road, Randall and his wife decide to chart a path northward, one restaurant at a time. As they research their route, Randall notices a name he hadn’t seen in ages: Taco Flats. Could this have anything to do with the old dive bar owned by Cozzzmic Carl Steele? The place where you could dine on a Hobo Plate while Townes Van Zandt would play an impromptu set? After some quick online research, Randall discovers that while it carries that heritage, it’s menu is considerably more upscale, in food and drink. They decide to check out the website to decide if they should make it their first stop.

##Mindy

Mindy’s best friend Allison is due to have a baby in 6 months and Mindy has been tasked with coming up with a shower for her. As with most expectant mothers, Allison is simultaneously having food cravings yet finding some food unappetizing to the point of disgust. She requests Mexican food for the shower but “not Maudie’s or any other crappy Tex-Mex”. This creates a challenge for Mindy, as the only restaurants who really have catering options set up are the “crappy Tex-Mex” ones. Someone he works with suggests Taco Flats and Mindy immediately recognizes the name as one of the newly opened restaurants on Burnet. She decides to check out their website.
